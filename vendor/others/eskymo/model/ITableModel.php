 * The names of columns which the MySQL table of the model contains should
 * be declared by constants started by "DATA_"
 * (for example const DATA_ID = 'entity_id')/
 *
 * If the model works with MySQL view, the names of its columns should be
 * declared similary way in constants started by "VIEW_" and the class should
 * declare the static method 'getView()'.
